## Java
- Simple, multi-threaded, garbage collected, object oriented, secure, platform independent
- `example.java` (java code) is compiled into `example.class` (java binary byte code), then it is run on the JVM (Java virtual machine) which is an interpreter which uses the JIT (Just in time compiler). 

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
### Procedural Programming
- Groups of actions that perform some task are formed into functions and functions are grouped to form programs. 

### Object Oriented Programming
- Programmers create user-defined types called classes which contains `attributes` (properties) and `methods` (procedures) that manipulate the data. 

## Inheritance
Inheritance refers to new classes inheriting the attributes and behaviours of existing classes.
- Sub classes has more attributes and methods than super classes.
